# Data: mammals sleep

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

msleep <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/msleep_ggplot2.csv"))

```

Data: The msleep (mammals sleep) data set contains the sleeptimes and weights for a set of mammals and is available in the dagdata repository on github. This data set contains `r nrow(msleep)` rows and `r ncol(msleep)` variables.

Let's take a look to the dataset

```{r}

glimpse(msleep)

```

# The columns (in order) correspond to the following:

| **column name** | **Description**                       |

# dplyr verbs in action

The two most basic functions are `select()` and `filter()` which selects columns and filters rows, respectively.

## Selecting columns using select()

Select a set of columns: the name and the sleep_total columns.

```{r}
sleepData <- select(msleep, name, sleep_total)
head(sleepData)
```

To select all the columns except a specific column, use the "-" (subtraction) operator (also known as negative indexing)

```{r}
head(select(msleep, -name))
```

```{r}
head(select(msleep, -c("name", "sleep_total")))
```

To select a range of columns by name, use the ":" (colon) operator

```{r}
head(select(msleep, name:order))
```

To select all columns that start with the character string "sl", use the function `starts_with()`

```{r}
head(select(msleep, starts_with("sl")))
```

Some additional options to select columns based on a specific criteria include

`ends_with()` = Select columns that end with a character string `contains()` = Select columns that contain a character string `matches()` = Select columns that match a regular expression `one_of()` = Select columns names that are from a group of names

## Selecting rows using filter()

Filter the rows for mammals that sleep a total of more than 16 hours.

```{r}
filter(msleep, sleep_total >= 16)
```

Filter the rows for mammals that sleep a total of more than 16 hours and have a body weight of greater than 1 kilogram.

```{r}
filter(msleep, sleep_total >= 16, bodywt >= 1)
```

Filter the rows for mammals in the Perissodactyla and Primates taxonomic order

```{r}
filter(msleep, order %in% c("Perissodactyla", "Primates"))
```

You can use the boolean operators (e.g. \>, \<, \>=, \<=, !=, %in%) to create the logical tests.

# Pipe operator: |> 

Before we go any futher, let's introduce the pipe operator: |> . This operator allows you to pipe the output from one function to the input of another function. Instead of nesting functions (reading from the inside to the outside), the idea of of piping is to read the functions from left to right.

**Note. There is another pipe operator %>% from magrittr package with the same functionality. The base pipe operator was introduced in R 4.1.0 in 2021 and it is recommended for use in your code.**

Here's an example you have seen:

```{r}
head(select(msleep, name, sleep_total))
```

Now in this case, we will pipe the msleep data frame to the function that will select two columns (name and sleep_total) and then pipe the new data frame to the function `head()` which will return the head of the new data frame.

```{r}
msleep |>  
    select(name, sleep_total) |>  
    head(10)
```

You will soon see how useful the pipe operator is when we start to combine many functions.

# Back to dplyr verbs in action

Now that you know about the pipe operator (|>), we will use it throughout the rest of this tutorial.

## Arrange or re-order rows using `arrange()`

To arrange (or re-order) rows by a particular column such as the taxonomic order, list the name of the column you want to arrange the rows by

```{r}
msleep |> arrange(order) |> head()
```

Now, we will select three columns from msleep, arrange the rows by the taxonomic order and then arrange the rows by sleep_total. Finally show the head of the final data frame

```{r}
msleep |>  
    select(name, order, sleep_total) |>
    arrange(order, sleep_total) |> 
    head()
```

Same as above, except here we filter the rows for mammals that sleep for 16 or more hours instead of showing the head of the final data frame

```{r}
msleep |> 
    select(name, order, sleep_total) |>
    arrange(order, sleep_total) |> 
    filter(sleep_total >= 16)
```

Something slightly more complicated: same as above, except arrange the rows in the sleep_total column in a descending order. For this, use the function desc()

```{r}
msleep |> 
    select(name, order, sleep_total) |>
    arrange(order, desc(sleep_total)) |> 
    filter(sleep_total >= 16)
```

## Create new columns using `mutate()`

The `mutate()` function will add new columns to the data frame. Create a new column called rem_proportion which is the ratio of rem sleep to total amount of sleep.

```{r}
msleep |> 
    mutate(rem_proportion = sleep_rem / sleep_total) |>
    select(name, sleep_rem, sleep_total, rem_proportion) |>
    head()
```

You can many new columns using mutate (separated by commas). Here we add a second column called bodywt_grams which is the bodywt column in grams.

```{r}
msleep |> 
    mutate(rem_proportion = sleep_rem / sleep_total, 
           bodywt_grams = bodywt * 1000, true_column = TRUE) |>
    select(name, sleep_rem, sleep_total, 
           rem_proportion, bodywt, bodywt_grams, true_column) |>
    head()
```

## Create summaries of the data frame using `summarise()`

The `summarise()` function will create summary statistics for a given column in the data frame such as finding the mean. For example, to compute the average number of hours of sleep, apply the `mean()` function to the column sleep_total and call the summary value avg_sleep.

```{r}
msleep |> 
    summarise(avg_sleep = mean(sleep_total))
```

There are many other summary statistics you could consider such `sd(), min(), max(), median(), sum(), n()` (returns the length of vector), `first()` (returns first value in vector), `last()` (returns last value in vector) and `n_distinct()` (number of distinct values in vector).

```{r}
msleep |> 
    summarise(avg_sleep = mean(sleep_total), 
              min_sleep = min(sleep_total),
              max_sleep = max(sleep_total),
              total = n())
```

## Group operations using `group_by()`

The `group_by()` verb is an important function in dplyr. As we mentioned before it's related to concept of "split-apply-combine". We literally want to split the data frame by some variable (e.g. taxonomic order), apply a function to the individual data frames and then combine the output.

Let's do that: split the msleep data frame by the taxonomic order, then ask for the same summary statistics as above. We expect a set of summary statistics for each taxonomic order.

```{r}
msleep |> 
    group_by(order) |>
    summarise(avg_sleep = mean(sleep_total), 
              min_sleep = min(sleep_total), 
              max_sleep = max(sleep_total),
              total = n())
```
